it is not ascetically pleasing, there is not usually a go back button or a lot of drop downs to help you if you are looking for something.

Each screen has a specific acronym that takes a while to remember, meaning, only daily users end up remembering what acronym you need to get to the right screen. Also, it takes several screens to see the complete information of a student's profile. For example, to see an application completely, I have to look at 5 different screens, each with different subtabs. With the new updated, it has been a little more difficult to navigate each screen since it's now more point and click friendly rather than keyboard navigation friendly. This is a drawback for longtime users.

That each screen is actually 2-4 screens and in order to move down, you have to control + page down and sometimes I tend to forget that limiting me from moving to the next screen.

The key-board short cuts have changed so that can be frustrating when entering data.

Everything is very much dependent on knowing the codes you have configured. Instead of having easy drop down menus, you need to write in the exact 4 digit codes

Learning the 7 letter codes for the searches is complicated, also the functionality of not being able to click to view, instead having to shortcut using keyboard buttons or clicks vs. the tradition mouse-click or enter, is tedious and challenging. It is not user friendly though I am holding out hope for banner 9.
